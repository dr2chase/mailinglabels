This little Go program renders addresses into a PDF that
is formatted for Avery 5160 labels.

Addresses are read from a text file "addresses.txt" and
each address must consist of three parts with parts
separated by the '$' character.

For example, here is a sample addresses.txt file:

=== addresses.txt =========================================
Google$1600 Amphitheater Parkway$Mountain View, CA 94943
Apple Inc.$1 Infinite Loop$Cupertino, CA 95014
Department of Mathematics$970 Evans Hall$Berkeley, CA 94720
===========================================================

Labels are written to a file named labels.pdf.

Released into the public domain.
